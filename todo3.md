I would like to clarify that this project should not perform any other features other than Intelligence management. If there's any analysis or fingerprinting or anything else I would rather create an entirely new project revolving around the automated usage of open source intelligence tools Rather than extending this current project. Does this make sense? so please make sure the scope of basset hound is more clearly defined, and help me to setup a new project to run osint automation.... it is acceptable to add tools to help verify information, but nothing more than this because the idea is to develope ai - enabled OSINT agents to leverage basset hound to store information and generate reports...

 it is not that the basset hound cannot enable automation of osint tools, it is just that i would rather create AI agents, as seen if you read through the current architecture of ~/palletai/ to perform all the tool automations, and then i want to extend the basset hound to have an mcp server or be able to have agents interact with it store intelligence in highly configurable ways, then the agents will have access to either system tools or use the browser to navigate to different websites to perform these automated osint procedures. so please update anything that ventures outside of the scope i am trying to clarify for basset hound. Features like Tor is extremely useful to be able to navigate the dark web and automate tasks on dark website like marketplaces for intelligence collection. does this help? please perform a cleanup of the roadmap and any features developed outside of the browser automation scope. If something does not add to the browser's ability to connect to networks and perform browsing and collect information, then it is probably outside of the scope. unless there are specific tools needed to digest certain information to send back to agents or people automating the browser if they are using the mcp or the api. does this help? feel free to spawn multiple agents as needed...

to clarify on tor, if you read through the ~/basset-hound-browser i have tried to develope techniques to run a local version of tor that would not depend on system installation, but then also be able to run with tor installed on the system. the end goal is to have basset hound installed in a docker container and deployed and be able to scale, so whether installing tor in that docker container at a system level or using a local non system dependent tor is up to you, but if a user adds a .onion address all im saying is it might be nice to verify it. Also, perhaps i would like to not automatically verify information, but rather have a button "verify" on the entity profile page if that makes sense, this way a user has discretion if they want to reach out to websites because sometimes threat actors can monitor traffic and shutdown their services if an unauthroized request comes in... so i don't want to just automatically verify websites so i would just rather not automatically verify all information. but then be able to verify information individually or on an entity-by-entity level... i don't want to add the ability to verify all information in the database because i want to gracefully handle non-verified data because i don't want to remove non-verified data because some things may be custom or such for different users. and i am hesitant to even have this complex verification system because it would be clunky and take away from the elegance of intelligence management. perhaps it would be better to make the data verification a completely separate system because in the future, verifying real estate records requires access to public databses and that is ouside the scope of basset hound itself, i would want to make a different project. in fact, i made a new git repository ~/basset-verify that i want to migrate all information Verification to. Please set up this new repository with a docs folder and then a findings folder inside the docs folder and then please develop a new road map for that new repository inside of the docs folder and then please develop a or refactor the README for that repository or create the new README file. And please make sure to define the scope more clearly inside the README for that repository and in the road map. And then otherwise please migrate all the data verification system from this current Basset Hound project into the Basset verify project and then please refactor Basset Hound to leverage Basset verify To perform information verification. But gracefully handle if bassett verify is not up and running so that as a hand will simply show verification unavailable and I can just simply continue development on Basset hound and that will not affect anything. Does this make sense? Feel free to spawn multiple agents as needed and even do web research as needed




 I would like to include in the scope for very basic data analysis like the hash of a file or image. this is getting at the idea of making suggestions for related data. so for the tag feature where a human operator can serach the database to tag related entities. I want to extend this feature to be able to search through all data in the database because some entities may share data in common. does this make sense? so if a name is in common then at the bottom of the profile, in the tag section, add a section for suggested tags, and keep in mind that the suggested tags does not need to be populated if not meeting suggestion criteria. but i want to give the opportunity for human operators to view data that may be an exact match between entities and between entities and orphanded data, and this may help with deduplication as well. for example, a suggestion that data may already exist in the database and check to see if this data is the same. sometimes there may be data with the same values for example two people may have the same address, but the address is in different states because maybe the addresses were not completely entered - only a partial address, so the human operator should be able to not have to relate these two entities. but if an image is uploaded and it matches the hash of another image in the database, provide the suggestion and be able to view the ID of the data for the human operator to independently verify the information. does this make sense? i would also like to generate IDs for data instead of just entities as well if that makes sense. this way data on a profile that matches orphaned data are not forced to deduplicate. does this make sense? please help me clarify these ideas in the roadmap and more clearly define the scope of the project - because these ideas fall under intelligence management.... does this make sense? so i want your assistance with planning on how to implement these features into the project. otherwise continue with what you were doing....
