As you become familiar with this project you'll notice that it is geared towards storing and organizing information of various entities and how they are related and then being able to draw connections to form more accurate OSINT reports I would like to begin with mentioning that I want to make this project work in conjunction with A chrome extension that I am developing to help this project have access to a browser because Python selenium and chrome driver or just simply the request module don't cut it for bot detection and by anyway there will be a human operator in the loop so therefore there should be either a chrome extension or firefox browser extension that should be made use of to help automate that browser and help automate the information collection system. Various tools that require a login on the web the user should be able to log into those and then other tools that are free should be able to be helped by being automated And then of course system tool should be able to be run just fine. I also have another repository called ~/osint-resources Where I try to organize a mdbook To serve as a wealth of knowledge of OSINT tools and resources be it anything from system packages to open source code like Github repositories or free websites or even paid services that you may have to access a website for. And all three of these repositories including this one are supposed to work in conjunction with each other and I want to basically also allow this repository to have some sort of LLM agent for the ability to deploy and help develop OSINT investigations. However at the same time I am also developing another project ~/palletAI That will eventually use a decentralized comprehensive knowledge base to be able to launch agents for all sorts of cybersecurity topics or any topic that I deem so or want to add to the knowledge base and now Bassethound has become sort of an app to enable relations between entities and so I want to further develop Basset Hound so that it can perhaps become more automated as a tool and then also develop the Chrome browser extension as previously mentioned before so that something like AI agent can interact with the browser autonomously and continuously view what is existing on that browser and work with various input systems on HTML forms and then maybe even try to work with the OSINT resources Repository to add information to all these tools listed below like for example how various HTML forms may show up and everything but I get that a lot of the files in the OSINT resources repository are very large because it's simply so many thousands and thousands of tools it's hard to add documentation for all of them. So I'm really struggling to be able to refactor this Basset Hound project in order to be able to be integrated with AI agents and build that comprehensive knowledge database with the OSINT resources repository and then be able to let Basset houndwork in conjunction with that and then also build out the autofill extension repository because at the same time that may become something useful beyond the usage of Basset Hound where I could have various penetration testing tools or cyber security tools perform various actions on various websites automatically for me for example I want to make a bug bounty or bug bounty agent that will be able to interact with websites on my behalf and then generate vulnerability assessments to report to clients. Does this all make sense? So I guess what I'm saying is I want you to do your research on all the code bases for all these repositories and then create a new docs folder In the local ~/basset-hound Folder and document your findings for how you would restructure everything and how you would make everything be able to work together and how you would keep Basset Hound as an independent application or tool for automation for enabling procedures in OSINT. And then develop a comprehensive road map of what all you would suggest doing across these repositories because I really want to keep pallet AI Independent and able to deploy various agents to deploy complex tasks and as you read through the code base of that project agents will be able to spawn coworkers and I just want to make as much knowledge available to those agents and give them as many tools and knowledge about tools as possible. And right now I want you to focus on specifically the ability to integrate browser automation through the browser extension and then also using or developing something like Basset Hound to help with the cybersecurity investigations that may not be for OSINT necessarily but also general network PIN testing as what would be seen in the OSCP Maybe this could be a tool developed to enable AI agents to not only generate tool outputs or tool reports onto the local file system but also be able to analyze those reports and store meaningful information into entity organizer and relationship maker Something like Basset Hound. Basically please do an initial findings and code based analysis for all these projects and figure out how these repositories could be intertwined and leverage existing features across these repositories and build them to work together rather than having to build a new system. And feel free to spawn as many claude agents as needed to perform these tasks
