## Phase 1 - Manage People Data

 - [ ] hops
	- [ ] list / table / tags of other related people by hopping in profile
	- [ ] if person1 is related to person2 and person2 is related to person3, then person3 is related to person1
	- [ ] keep track of how many hops between a person
 - [ ] when delete person, choice to keep files
	- [ ] choice which files to keep (can choose all)
	- [ ] if files not chosen to keep, delete files
	- [ ] if chose to keep files
		- [ ] zip user files and append user's display name to zip (in a safe format for fs)
		- [ ] prompt with path to folder containing files
 - [ ] fast api for automating people adding/editing/deleting data import and export
 - [ ] neo4j (dockerized)
 - [ ] graphical/visual connections (map.html)
	- [ ] show first hop connections on a person's profile
	- [ ] "Graph Connections" button to show recursive hop connetions on a new page

## Phase 2 - Performing Background Tasks
 - [ ] get permission to open multiple new tabs before trying to open multiple new tabs?
 - [ ] Conduct OSINT (tison.html)
 	- [ ] load user data
 	- [ ] categories of OSINT tools
 		- [ ] osint tools config
 			- [ ] required fields
 			- [ ] non-reqiured fields
 			- [ ] if no fields, ok just take user to url
 			- [ ] if fields, take user to url with populated fields 
 		- [ ] interactive lists of tools
 	- [ ] search multiple search engines at once
  		- [ ] clearnet
    		- [ ] tor (must be inside tor browser) 	 	
       - [ ] automate google dorks, search public records, verify social media

## Phase 3 - Manage Fake People?
 - [ ] Generate Fake People With Full Information
	- [ ] generate passwords
 	- [ ] automatically make social media accounts? 
 	- [ ] Automate Create Email Account?
  	- [ ] Smokescreen Activity / Normalize activity
   		- [ ] Subscribe to newsletters


 - [ ] recently opened projects on index.html


## Helpful prompts to currently work with







I now want to add the functionality to create a network of people based on who they tag and render this on a new page "map.html". I want make a button on a user's profile next to "edit" and "delete" labeld "map". when clicked, this button will open a new tab with the url of the map page, load the data from the person's profile from which the map button was clicked, and then render a recursive, visual network of connections stemming from this individual. I want to use transitive relationship logic - if person1 is related to person2 and person2 is related to person3, then person3 is related to person1. I will consider the people tagged on a person's profile (the subject) as 1 hop from the subject, then the people tagged on the profiles of the people tagged on the subject's profile will be considered 2 hops from the subject. I want to keep track of the routes and combinations of hops between everybody, essentially performing recursion. I want to make a new page called "tagged.html" where I want to have a dynamic, visual graph of all the connections between all the people.

logic: if person1 is related to person2 and person2 is related to person3, then person3 is related to person1

feature: when person1 is tagged in person2's profile, update all other connections between people in the app recursively.
