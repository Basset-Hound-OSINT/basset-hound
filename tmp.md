ok so again, i don't need authentication because this applications is supposed to be open source and locally run by developers, unless it is for something else. and then if it is for local user authentication then please just configure default credentials, i definitely don't want to have to deal with diferent users accounts for this application, that is not the point of this application if that makes sense, it is to simply accomplish handling relations between data and help with reporting and more such as allowing external applications to leverage the MCP / API does this make sesnes? please clean up this application to remove redundant and problematic or bloated code and then please reflect changes and ideas in the roadmap, then test all changes. feel free to spawn multiple claude agents.
